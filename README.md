## Contributing

I would really like to accept PRs to expand the functionalities of this plugin, in example to add new Senders (for services like JIRA, Trello, GitHub, etc), so don't be shy! :)

All the community contributions will be always free to use and open source.

If you want to contribute, take a look at the [API and Customization documentation](https://github.com/emanzione/REPORTS/wiki/API-and-Customization).
